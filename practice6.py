# Write a function that finds the length of the third side of a triangle. Function should have three
# arguments: one side of triangle, another side, angle between the sides. Ask the user to input the 
# two sides and the angle between them in degrees. Return the answer as a float and print it outside of 
# the function, format to two decimal points.
# Hint: Use the law of cosines formula
# Hint: The cos() function only takes radians, so use radians() function for conversion
