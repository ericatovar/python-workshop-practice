# Let's compute all the parameters of the loan. There are at least two kinds of loan: those with 
# annuity payment and those with differentiated payment. In this stage, you are going to calculate 
# only the former. Annuity type of payment consists in paying a fixed sum of money at specified 
# intervals, for example, each month or each year. The annuity payment amount is precisely this fixed 
# sum of money that you need to pay at regular intervals.

# Let's assume that annuity payments are made monthly. Thus, we can use the following formula to 
# calculate the monthly payment:

# A = P * i * pow(1 + i, n) / (pow(1 + i, n) - 1)

# Where:
# A = annuity payment
# P = loan principal
# i = nominal (monthly) interest rate. Usually, it is 1/12 of the annual interest rate and 
#     is a floating value, not a percentage. For example, if your annual interest rate = 12%, then i = 0.01
# n = number of payments. This is usually the number of months in which repayments will be made

# So far, in this stage you are interested in four values: the number of monthly payments required to repay 
# the loan, the monthly payment amount, the loan principal, and the loan interest. Each of these values can 
# be calculated if others are known:

 # Loan principal: P = A / (i * pow(1 + i, n) / (pow(1 + i, n) - 1))

 # The number of payments: n = log(A / (A - i * P), i + 1)

 ### Objective ###
 # In this stage, you should add new behavior to the calculator:

# 1) First, you should ask the user which parameter they want to calculate. The calculator should be able to 
#    calculate the number of monthly payments, the monthly payment amount, and the loan principal.
# 2) Then, you need to ask them to input the remaining values.
# 3) Finally, compute and output the value that they wanted.
# Note that you have to ask the user to input parameters in a specific order which is provided below. Simply 
# skip the value the user wants to calculate:
#       1) The first is the loan principal (P in the formulas).
#       2) The second is the monthly payment (A in the formulas).
#       3) The next is the number of monthly payments (n in the formulas).
#       4) The last is the loan interest. The user inputs the interest rate as a percentage, for example, 
#           11.7. You should divide this value by 12 and 100 to use it as i in the formula.

# NOTE: Please be careful converting "X months" to "Y years and Z months". Avoid writing "0 years and 11 months" 
# (output "11 months" instead) and "1 years and 0 months" (output "1 year" instead).

### Output ###
# NOTE: The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that this is not part of the input.

# Example 1: calculating the number of monthly payments

# What do you want to calculate?
# type "n" for number of monthly payments,
# type "a" for annuity monthly payment amount,
# type "p" for loan principal:
# > n
# Enter the loan principal:
# > 1000000
# Enter the monthly payment:
# > 15000
# Enter the loan interest:
# > 10
# It will take 8 years and 2 months to repay this loan!

# Example 2: calculating the monthly payment (the annuity payment)
# NOTE: Use A = P * i * pow(i + 1, n) / (pow(i + 1, n) - 1)

# What do you want to calculate?
# type "n" for number of monthly payments,
# type "a" for annuity monthly payment amount,
# type "p" for loan principal:
# > a
# Enter the loan principal:
# > 1000000
# Enter the number of periods:
# > 60
# Enter the loan interest:
# > 10
# Your monthly payment = 21248!

# Example 3: calculating the loan principal

# What do you want to calculate?
# type "n" for number of monthly payments,
# type "a" for annuity monthly payment amount,
# type "p" for loan principal:
# > p
# Enter the annuity payment:
# > 8721.8
# Enter the number of periods:
# > 120
# Enter the loan interest:
# > 5.6
# Your loan principal = 800000!
