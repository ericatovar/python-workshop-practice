# Let's think about what a loan calculator should be able to do. In general, it takes several parameters like 
# a loan principal and interest, calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment 
# or overpayment), and outputs them to the user.

# Not familiar with these concepts? Don't worry, we will explain them to you in simple terms. The principal is 
# the original amount of money you borrow. The interest is a charge for borrowing that money, usually calculated 
# as a percentage of the principal amount.

### Objective ###
# Let's start by imitating this behavior. There are some prepared variables in the source code: 
# these are text messages that our loan calculator can output. In this stage, all you need to do 
# is output them in the right order.

### Output ###
# Loan principal: 1000
# Month 1: repaid 250
# Month 2: repaid 250
# Month 3: repaid 500
# The loan has been repaid!

### Start here ###
loan_principal = 'Loan principal: 1000'
final_output = 'The loan has been repaid!'
first_month = 'Month 1: repaid 250'
second_month = 'Month 2: repaid 250'
third_month = 'Month 3: repaid 500'

### Write here ###
print(loan_principal)
print(first_month)
print(second_month)
print(third_month)
print(final_output)
