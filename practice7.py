# Name:

# Create a plot of the function y = 8 * sinc(x)
# Include a proper title, axis labels, legend, and a grid
# Customize the color and style for the line
# HINT: line styles include the following [ '-' | '--' | '-.' | ':' | 'steps' | ...] and are included in
#       the same string as the color change ex: 'b--'

# Create a 3D plot of the same function as the previous problem
# Use the following to create the 3D plot:

# ax = plt.figure().add_subplot(projection='3d')
# ax.plot(x, y, zs=0, zdir='y')

# NOTE: x and y should be the x-axis and y-axis data from the previous problem

# For extra fun, make a for loop that will run in a range using linspace() and plot
# multiple sinc() functions in the xz plane at different values of y
